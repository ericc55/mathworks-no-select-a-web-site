# Remove MathWorks "Select a Web Site" Popup

For those people who are tired of the annoying "Select a Web Site" popup that appears on MathWorks pages. This simple script automatically removes it so you can browse without interruptions.

## What it does
- Automatically removes the "Select a Web Site" popup
- Restores normal page scrolling
- Works on all MathWorks pages

### Import from file (Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey)
1. Download `main.js` to your computer.
2. Tampermonkey: Dashboard → Utilities → Import from file → select `main.js` → Install
3. Violentmonkey: Dashboard → Settings → Import → select `main.js`

## Usage
- Visit any MathWorks page (e.g., https://www.mathworks.com/).
- If the site tries to show “Select a Web Site,” the overlay will be removed automatically and scrolling will be restored.

If you need to use a real popup on a MathWorks page, you can temporarily turn off the script from your browser extension menu.
